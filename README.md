# puppet-crypt

This is a Puppet module to install and configure [Crypt](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/crypt).

## Configuration

```yaml
---
classes:
  - crypt

crypt::crypt_version: "3.0.0"
crypt::server_url: "http://crypt"
crypt::remove_plist: true
crypt::package_source: "puppet:///modules/bigfiles/crypt/my_special_crypt.pkg"
crypt::payload_organization: "Example Organization"
crypt::crypt_files:
  - "/Library/Crypt/checkin"
  - "/Library/Crypt/FoundationPlist.py"
  - "/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.grahamgilbert.crypt.plist"
  - "/Library/Security/SecurityAgentPlugins/Crypt.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Crypt"
crypt::wait_for_user: false
crypt::force_install: false
crypt::output_path: "/var/root/crypt_output.plist"
```

The path to the install package on your Puppet server. Defaults to `puppet:///modules/bigfiles/crypt/-${munkitools_version}.pkg`, which means that the install package should be in the `bigfiles` module, in `files/crypt`, named to match the version.

By default this module will only manage Crypt on macOS devices that are either:

- Laptops
- Have Crypt managed by Munki

If you wish to install and configure it on all macOS devices, regardless of their state, set `crypt::force_install` to `true`.

There have been issues with installing and configuring Crypt's modifications to the Authorization database when there are no users configured on the system. To stop this happening, set `crypt::wait_for_user` to `true` (the default). Set this to `false` only if you know the risks involved.

Pass a list of files to watch for that if missing, will trigger an installation of the Crypt package via `crypt::crypt_files`. The defaults should be fine, unless the package has been modified.
